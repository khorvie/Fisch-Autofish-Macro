To ensure the macro functions optimally, **set your Windows screen scale to 100%.** This prevents any potential misalignment that could disrupt the macro's performance.

## Default Key Bindings (you can change binds in the settings.cfg file)
- Enable Macro: P  
- Restart Macro: O  
- Disable Macro: M  

`I'm not sure about the Success Rate but it seems to be around 99%`. I tested it for 5 hours straight with no loss of streak.

Happy fishing!
